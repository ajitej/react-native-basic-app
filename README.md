# react-native-basic-app
This is a basic react-native app. The app is divided into 6 components with each component has different functionality associated to it.
## Component 1:-
Component1 is the basic component dealing with the concept of `props` and `state`. In order to run component in your app, in `index.android.js/index.ios.js`, replace the `component` with `component1`.
## Component 2:-
In component two we have added styles, using `StyleSheet` of react-native.In order to run component in your app, in `index.android.js/index.ios.js`, replace the `component` with `component2`.
## Component 3:-
In component 3 we have fetched value from text input, as well as added a switch.In order to run component in your app, in `index.android.js/index.ios.js`, replace the `component` with `component3`.
## Component 4:-
In component 4 we have rendered row to display data of an array. In order to run component in your app, in `index.android.js/index.ios.js`, replace the `component` with `component4`.
## Component 5:-
In component 5 we have fetched data from an API using get call and display it in flexbox. In order to run component in your app, in `index.android.js/index.ios.js`, replace the `component` with `component5`.
## Component 5:-
With the help of component 5, we have made a navigation between two components, i.e. `component5 and component6`. The current `index.android.js/index.ios.js` have the code for the navigation between these two components.

##p.s. i am expecting that you have done the react-native setup in your system and has followed the tut for creating a basic app using the react-native doc. If not, please refer `https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html`
Name of component are set as component1, component2.. etc because it is not a project but a basic app to learn basic working.
